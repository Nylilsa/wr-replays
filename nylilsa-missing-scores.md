| **631M**   | 2013  | Aqura  | only mention is in the description of [cactu's 647m](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6nUD4OsUuWY), maybe you can ask an old EoSD player if they know more about it                                                                                                                                                                       |

tl;dr there's a lot and you should just scrape all of the replays on https://th7.pndsng.com/?Yu-suke

| 3,098,708,520 | 2/26/2011 | HS参謀 | I think there was a screenshot on HS's twitter or something |

There are also a bunch of unverified Naya WRs according to https://pbs.twimg.com/media/DRujMipVwAIFyLo?format=jpg&name=900x900 but I have no idea what the source for that is. Also there is indeed a replay for Naya's 3.6b, but it is not publicly available. I am not sure if we should post it publicly either because Naya seemed to give it to people who ask him.

Remove the 2,214,529,240 entry. It was almost certainly cheated, and it's not confirmed that it was by LYX either (I think it was initially uploaded to RF under the name "名前の無い怪物". In 2021, a troll re-uploaded the replay under the name "LYX".)

Videos of LYX's score can all be found at https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLW9nVJ0E0nhg57r3TvLAk2UB_lxzmOFDM. Don't think any replays exist.
